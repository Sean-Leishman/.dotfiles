In order to install nvim configuration use the latest version of nvim:
```
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim.appimage
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
./nvim.appimage

# Rename and add to PATH as necessary"
```

Ensure that the correct `nvim` is being referenced via `which nvim`. Shout out the necessary files and use `PackerSync` while within the `packer.lua` file
